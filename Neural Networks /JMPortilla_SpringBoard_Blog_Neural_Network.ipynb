    "The most popular machine learning library for Python is [SciKit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/). The latest version (0.18) now has built in support for Neural Network models! In this article we will learn how Neural Networks work and how to implement them with the Python programming language and latest version of SciKit-Learn! Basic understanding of Python is necessary to understand this article, and it would also be helpful (but not necessary) to have some experience with Sci-Kit Learn. "

    "## Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks are a machine learning framework that attempts to mimic the learning pattern of natural biological neural networks. Biological neural networks have interconnected neurons with dendrites that receive inputs, then based on these inputs they produce an output signal through an axon to another neuron. We will try to mimic this process through the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which we will just refer to as neural networks from now on. The process of creating a neural network begins with the most basic form, a single perceptron. Let's start by explaining the single perceptron!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start our discussion by talking about the Perceptron! A perceptron has one or more inputs, a bias, an activation function, and a single output. The perceptron receives inputs, multiplies them by some weight, and then passes them into an activation function to produce an output. There are many possible activation functions to choose from, such as the logistic function, a trigonometric function, a step function etc. We also make sure to add a bias to the perceptron, this avoids issues where all inputs could be equal to zero (meaning no multiplicative weight would have an effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the output we can compare it to a known label and adjust the weights accordingly (the weights usually start off with random initialization values). We keep repeating this process until we have reached a maximum number of allowed iterations, or an acceptable error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a neural network, we simply begin to add layers of perceptrons together, creating a multi-layer perceptron model of a neural network. You'll have an input layer which directly takes in your feature inputs and an output layer which will create the resulting outputs. Any layers in between are known as hidden layers because they don't directly \"see\" the feature inputs or outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that due to their nature, neural networks tend to work better on GPU than on CPU. The sci-kit learn framework isn't built for GPU optimization. If you want to continue to GPU and distributed models, take a look at some other frameworks, such as Google's open sourced TensforFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move on to actually creating a neural network with Python and Sci-Kit Learn!"

    "For this analysis we will cover one of life's most important topics - Wine! All joking aside, [wine fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_fraud) is actually very real thing. Let's see if Neural Networks can help with this problem! We will use the wine data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It has various chemical features of different wines, all grown in the same region in Italy, but the data is labeled by three different possible cultivars. We will try to build a model that can classify what cultivar a wine belongs to based on its chemical features using Neural Networks. You can get the data [here.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine).\n",
