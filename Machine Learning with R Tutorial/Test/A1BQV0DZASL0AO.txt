The greatest fantasy story ever written published the way it was meant to be - in a single volume.  The book is sturdy and well-made.  It has held up to my nine year old carrying it around for a couple of months now with no sign of damage.  If you want a grand presentation gift for a big LOTR fan, choose one of the expensive boxed sets, but if you want to read the book, this is the one to choose.
