This is a 3 books in one group and over 1100 pages.  However, the story telling, descriptions and poetry are lovely.  I have finished, thus far, about half the book and can't put it down, although I can only read in the evening.  I bought it used and it was in the good condition that it was advertised and also arrived well within the time allotted for delivery.
