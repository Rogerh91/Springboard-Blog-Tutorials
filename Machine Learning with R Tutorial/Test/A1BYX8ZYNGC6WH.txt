I love J.R.R. Tolkien's works.  He is the father of Fantasy and inspired all other works.  He is great at telling a story, painting a detailed and descriptive world, and putting so many layers of depth and complexity that it really makes the mind work to take it all in, understand it and visualize.  I love it!
